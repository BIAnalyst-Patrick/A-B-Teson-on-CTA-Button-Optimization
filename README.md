## 6. Limitations & Considerations

### 6.1 Test Limitations
- **External Validity:** Results may vary across different user segments, geographic regions, or seasonal periods
- **Novelty Effect:** Initial improvement might decrease over time as users adapt to new design
- **Single Metric Focus:** Analysis limited to click-through rate; downstream conversion and revenue impact not measured in this test
- **Temporal Factors:** Test conducted during specific time period; performance may vary during different business cycles
- **Device/Browser Variations:** Detailed breakdown by device type and browser not included in primary analysis

### 6.2 Statistical Assumptions & Validity
- **Sample Independence:** Assumes no cross-contamination between groups ✓
- **Random Assignment:** Users properly randomized to control/treatment ✓
